## Overview

The KMS permissions system is based on a role-based access control (RBAC) model. The system allows you to define roles and assign them to users and machines. Each role has a set of permissions that define what actions a user can perform.

Permissions are built on a subject-action-object model. The subject is the resource the permission is being applied to, the action is what the permission allows.
An example of a subject/action combination would be `secrets/read`. This permission allows the subject to read secrets.

## Permission Scope Levels

KMS's permission system operates at two distinct levels, providing comprehensive and flexible access control across your entire security infrastructure:

### Project Permissions

Project permissions control access to resources within a specific project, including secrets management, PKI, KMS, and SSH certificate functionality.

For a comprehensive list of all project-level subjects, actions, and detailed descriptions, please refer to the [Project Permissions](/internals/permissions/project-permissions) documentation.

### Organization Permissions

Organization permissions control access to organization-wide resources and settings such as workspaces, billing, identity providers, and more.

For a comprehensive list of all organization-level subjects, actions, and detailed descriptions, please refer to the [Organization Permissions](/internals/permissions/organization-permissions) documentation.

## Inversion

Permission inversion allows you to explicitly deny actions instead of allowing them. This is supported for the following subjects:

- secrets
- secret-folders
- secret-imports
- dynamic-secrets

When a permission is inverted, it changes from an "allow" rule to a "deny" rule. For example:

```typescript
// Regular permission - allows reading secrets
{
  subject: "secrets",
  action: ["read"]
}

// Inverted permission - denies reading secrets
{
  subject: "secrets",
  action: ["read"],
  inverted: true
}
```

**Important:** The order of permissions matters when using inversion. For inverted (deny) permissions to be effective, there
typically needs to be a corresponding allow permission somewhere in the chain. Permissions are evaluated in sequence,
so the relative positioning of allow and deny rules determines the final access outcome.

## Conditions

Conditions allow you to create more granular permissions by specifying criteria that must be met for the permission to apply. This is supported for the following subjects:

- secrets
- secret-folders
- secret-imports
- dynamic-secrets

### Properties

Conditions can be applied to the following properties:

- `environment`: Control access based on environment slugs
- `secretPath`: Control access based on secret paths
- `secretName`: Control access based on secret names
- `secretTags`: Control access based on tags (only supports $in operator)

### Operators

The following operators are available for conditions:

| Operator | Description                        | Example                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `$eq`    | Equal                              | `{ environment: { $eq: "production" } }`              |
| `$ne`    | Not equal                          | `{ environment: { $ne: "development" } }`             |
| `$in`    | Matches any value in array         | `{ environment: { $in: ["staging", "production"] } }` |
| `$glob`  | Pattern matching using glob syntax | `{ secretPath: { $glob: "/app/\*" } }`                |

These details are especially useful if you're using the API to [create new project roles](../api-reference/endpoints/project-roles/create).
The rules outlined on this page, also apply when using our Terraform Provider to manage your KMS project roles, or any other of our clients that manage project roles.
