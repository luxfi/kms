# Migrating from Permission V1 to Permission V2

This guide provides instructions for upgrading from the legacy V1 permissions system to the more powerful V2 permissions system in KMS.

## Why Upgrade to V2?

The V2 permissions system offers several advantages over V1:

- **More granular control**: Separate permissions for different secret-related resources
- **Explicit deny rules**: Support for permission inversion
- **Conditional permissions**: Apply permissions based on specific criteria
- **Array-based actions**: Cleaner syntax for multiple actions

## Migration Steps

When upgrading to V2 permissions (i.e., when moving from using the `permissions` to `permissions_v2` field in your Terraform configurations, or upgrading to the V2 permission API), you'll need to update your permission structure as follows:

### 1. Expand Secret Permissions

Any permissions for `secrets` should be expanded to include equivalent permissions for:

- `secret-imports`
- `secret-folders` (except for read permissions)
- `dynamic-secrets`

### 2. Map Dynamic Secret Actions

For dynamic secrets, the actions need to be mapped differently:

| V1 Action | V2 Action                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `read`    | `read-root-credential`                                |
| `create`  | `create-root-credential`                              |
| `edit`    | `edit-root-credential` (also adds `lease` permission) |
| `delete`  | `delete-root-credential`                              |

### 3. Update Configuration Format

V2 permissions use a different syntax, with actions stored in arrays and an optional `inverted` flag:

```typescript
// V1 format (single action)
{
  subject: "secrets",
  action: "read"
}

// V2 format (array of actions)
{
  subject: "secrets",
  action: ["read"],
  inverted: false  // Optional, defaults to false
}
```

## Example Migration

Here's a complete example showing how to migrate a role from V1 to V2:

```hcl
# Old V1 configuration
resource "kms_project_role" "example" {
  name = "example"
  permissions = [
    {
      subject = "secrets"
      action = "read"
    },
    {
      subject = "secrets"
      action = "edit"
    }
  ]
}

# New V2 configuration
resource "kms_project_role" "example" {
  name = "example"
  permissions_v2 = [
    # Original secrets permission
    {
      subject = "secrets"
      action = ["read", "edit"]
      inverted = false
    },
    # Add equivalent secret-imports permission
    {
      subject = "secret-imports"
      action = ["read", "edit"]
      inverted = false
    },
    # Add secret-folders permission (without read)
    {
      subject = "secret-folders"
      action = ["edit"]
      inverted = false
    },
    # Add dynamic-secrets permission with mapped actions
    {
      subject = "dynamic-secrets"
      action = ["read-root-credential", "edit-root-credential", "lease"]
      inverted = false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Important Considerations

- When moving to V2 permissions, make sure to include all the necessary expanded permissions based on your original `secrets` permissions.
- V2 permissions give you the ability to use conditions and inversion, which are not available in V1.
- During migration, review your existing roles and consider if more granular permissions would better fit your security requirements.
- Test your migrated permissions thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
