description: "Find out how to use KMS to inject environment variables into services defined in your Docker Compose file."

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [KMS Cloud](https://kms.lux.network)

## Configure the KMS CLI for each service

Follow this [guide](./docker) to configure the KMS CLI for each service that you wish to inject environment variables into; you'll have to update the Dockerfile of each service.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Machine Identity (Recommended)">
    ### Generate and configure machine identity
    Generate a machine identity for each service you want to inject secrets into. You can do this by following the steps in the [Machine Identity](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities) guide.

    ### Set the machine identity client ID and client secret as environment variables
    For each service you want to inject secrets into, generate the required `KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_A` and `KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_B`.

    ```yaml
    # Example Docker Compose file
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        image: example-service-1
        environment:
          - KMS_TOKEN=${KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_A}

      api:
        build: .
        image: example-service-2
        environment:
          - KMS_TOKEN=${KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_B}

    ```

    ### Export shell variables
    Next, set the shell variables you defined in your compose file. This can be done manually or via your CI/CD environment. Once done, it will be used to populate the corresponding `KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_A` and `KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_B` in your Docker Compose file.

    ```bash
    #Example

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_A=$(kms login --method=universal-auth --client-id=<your-client-id> --client-secret=<your-client-secret> --silent --plain)
    export KMS_TOKEN_SERVICE_B=$(kms login --method=universal-auth --client-id=<your-client-id> --client-secret=<your-client-secret> --silent --plain)

    # Then run your compose file in the same terminal.
    docker-compose ...
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Service Token">

    ## Generate service token
    Generate a unique [Service Token](/documentation/platform/token) for each service.

    ## Feed service token to your Docker Compose file

    For each service you want to inject secrets into, set an environment variable called `KMS_TOKEN` equal to a unique identifier variable.

    In the example below, we set `KMS_TOKEN_FOR_WEB` and `KMS_TOKEN_FOR_API` as the `KMS_TOKEN` for the services.

    ```yaml
    # Example Docker Compose file
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        image: example-service-1
        environment:
          - KMS_TOKEN=${KMS_TOKEN_FOR_WEB}

      api:
        build: .
        image: example-service-2
        environment:
          - KMS_TOKEN=${KMS_TOKEN_FOR_API}
    ```

    ## Export shell variables

    Next, set the shell variables you defined in your compose file. This can be done manually or via your CI/CD environment. Once done, it will be used to populate the corresponding `KMS_TOKEN`
    in your Docker Compose file.

    ```bash
    #Example

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export KMS_TOKEN_FOR_WEB=<token>

    # Token refers to the token we generated in step 2 for this service
    export KMS_TOKEN_FOR_API=<token>

    # Then run your compose file in the same terminal.
    docker-compose ...
    ```
