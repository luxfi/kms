description: "How to use KMS to inject environment variables and secrets into a Gatsby app."
---

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [KMS Cloud](https://kms.lux.network)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize KMS for your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) app

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize KMS
kms init
```

## Start your application as usual but with KMS

```bash
kms run -- <your application start command>

# Example
kms run -- npm run develop
```

<Note>
  Note that for environment variables to be exposed to the client, you'll have
  to prefix them with `GATSBY_`. Read more about that
  [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/#accessing-environment-variables-in-the-browser).
