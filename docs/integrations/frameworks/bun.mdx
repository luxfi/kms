Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [KMS Cloud](https://kms.lux.network)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize KMS for your [Bun](https://bun.sh)

```bash
# navigate to the root of your of your project 
cd /path/to/project

# then initialize kms
kms init
```

## Start your application as usual but with KMS

```bash
kms run -- <your application start command>

# Example
kms run -- bun run dev
```

<Info>
  Bun environment variables can be called as either `Bun.env.SECRET` or `process.env.SECRET`. We also recommend you check this more in-depth [guide to environment variables in Bun](https://lux.network/blog/bun-environment-variables).
