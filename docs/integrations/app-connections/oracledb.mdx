<Info>
    OracleDB App Connection is a paid feature.

    If you're using KMS Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting KMS,
    then you should contact team@lux.network to purchase an enterprise license to use it.
</Info>

KMS supports connecting to OracleDB using a database user.

## Configure an Oracle Database User for KMS

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a User">
        KMS recommends creating a designated user in your Oracle Database for your connection.
        ```SQL
        -- create user
        CREATE USER kms IDENTIFIED BY "my-password";

        -- grant create session privileges
        GRANT CREATE SESSION TO kms;
        ```
        <Note>
          Username must either be ALL UPPERCASE or not be surrounded by "quotes". Values not surrounded by quotes get automatically transformed to uppercase by Oracle Database.
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Grant Relevant Permissions">
       Depending on how you intend to use your OracleDB connection, you'll need to grant one or more of the following permissions.
        <Tip>
            To learn more about the Oracle Database permission system, please visit their [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/dbseg/configuring-privilege-and-role-authorization.html).

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Secret Rotation">
                For Secret Rotations, your KMS user will require the ability to alter other users' passwords:
                ```SQL
                -- enable permissions to alter login credentials
                GRANT ALTER USER TO kms;
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get Connection Details">
        You'll need the following information to create your Oracle Database connection:
        - `host` - The hostname or IP address of your Oracle Database server
        - `port` - The port number your Oracle Database server is listening on (default: 1521)
        - `database` - The Oracle Service Name or SID (System Identifier) for the database you are connecting to. For example: `ORCL`, `FREEPDB1`, `XEPDB1`
        - `username` - The user name of the login created in the steps above
        - `password` - The user password of the login created in the steps above
        - `sslCertificate` (optional) - The SSL certificate required for connection (if configured)

        <Note>
            If you are self-hosting KMS and intend to connect to an internal/private IP address, be sure to set the `ALLOW_INTERNAL_IP_CONNECTIONS` environment variable to `true`.
        </Note>
    </Step>

## Create Connection in KMS

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="KMS UI">
        1. Navigate to the App Connections tab on the Organization Settings page.
        ![App Connections Tab](/images/app-connections/general/add-connection.png)

        2. Select the **OracleDB Connection** option.
        ![Select OracleDB Connection](/images/app-connections/oracledb/select-oracledb-connection.png)

        3. Select the **Username & Password** method option and provide the details obtained from the previous section and press **Connect to OracleDB**.

        <Note>
            Optionally, if you'd like KMS to manage the credentials of this connection, you can enable the Platform Managed Credentials option.
            If enabled, KMS will update the password of the connection on creation to prevent external access to this database user.
        </Note>

        ![Create OracleDB Connection](/images/app-connections/oracledb/create-username-and-password-method.png)

        4. Your **OracleDB Connection** is now available for use.
        ![Assume User OracleDB Connection](/images/app-connections/oracledb/username-and-password-connection.png)
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="API">
        To create an Oracle Database Connection, make an API request to the [Create OracleDB Connection](/api-reference/endpoints/app-connections/oracledb/create) API endpoint.

        <Note>
            Optionally, if you'd like KMS to manage the credentials of this connection, you can set the `isPlatformManagedCredentials` option to `true`.
            If enabled, KMS will update the password of the connection on creation to prevent external access to this database user.
        </Note>

        ### Sample request

        ```bash Request
        curl    --request POST \
        --url https://kms.lux.network/api/v1/app-connections/oracledb \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "name": "my-oracledb-connection",
            "method": "username-and-password",
            "isPlatformManagedCredentials": true,
