description: "Learn how to sync secrets from KMS to AWS Amplify."

Prerequisites:

- KMS Cloud account
- Add the secrets you wish to sync to Amplify to [KMS Cloud](https://kms.lux.network)

There are many approaches to sync secrets stored within KMS to AWS Amplify. This guide describes two such approaches below.

## Access KMS secrets at Amplify build time

This approach enables you to fetch secrets from KMS during Amplify build time.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Machine Identity (Recommended)">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a machine identity">
          Create a machine identtiy and connect it to your KMS project. You can read more about how to use machine identities [here](/documentation/platform/identities/machine-identities). The machine identity will allow you to authenticate and fetch secrets from KMS.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set the machine identity client ID and client secret as Amplify environment variables">
        ![aws amplify env console](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-amplify-env-console-identity.png)
        1. In the Amplify console, choose App Settings, and then select Environment variables.
        2. In the Environment variables section, select Manage variables.
        3. Under the first Variable enter `KMS_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`, and for the value, enter the client ID of the machine identity you created in the previous step.
        4. Under the second Variable enter `KMS_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and for the value, enter the client secret of the machine identity you created in the previous step.
        5. Click save.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Install KMS CLI to the Amplify build step">
        In the prebuild phase, add the command in AWS Amplify to install the KMS CLI.

        ```yaml
        build:
          phases:
            preBuild:
              commands:
        - sudo curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/kms/kms-cli/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
        - sudo yum -y install kms
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Modify the build command">
        You can now pull secrets from KMS using the CLI and save them as a `.env` file. To do this, modify the build commands.

        ```yaml
        build:
          phases:
            build:
              commands:
        - KMS_TOKEN=$(kms login --method=universal-auth --client-id=${KMS_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID} --client-secret=${KMS_MACHINE_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET} --silent --plain)
            - kms export --format=dotenv > .env
            - <rest of the commands>
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Service Token (Deprecated)">

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate a service token">
        Go to your project settings in the KMS dashboard to generate a [service token](/documentation/platform/token). This service token will allow you to authenticate and fetch secrets from KMS. Once you have created a service token with the required permissions, youâ€™ll need to provide the token to the CLI installed in your Docker container.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set the service token as an Amplify environment variable">
        ![aws amplify env console](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-amplify-env-console.png)
        1. In the Amplify console, choose App Settings, and then select Environment variables.
        2. In the Environment variables section, select Manage variables.
        3. Under Variable, enter the key **KMS_TOKEN**. For the value, enter the generated service token from the previous step.
        4. Click save.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install KMS CLI to the Amplify build step">
        In the prebuild phase, add the command in AWS Amplify to install the KMS CLI.

        ```yaml
        build:
          phases:
            preBuild:
              commands:
        - sudo curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/kms/kms-cli/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
        - sudo yum -y install kms
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Modify the build command">
        You can now pull secrets from KMS using the CLI and save them as a `.env` file. To do this, modify the build commands.

        ```yaml
        build:
          phases:
            build:
              commands:
        - KMS_TOKEN=${KMS_TOKEN}
            - kms export --format=dotenv > .env
            - <rest of the commands>
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ## Sync Secrets Using AWS SSM Parameter Store

    Another approach to use secrets from KMS in AWS Amplify is to utilize AWS Parameter Store.
    At high level, you begin by using KMS's AWS SSM Parameter Store integration to sync secrets from KMS to AWS SSM Parameter Store. You then instruct AWS Amplify to consume those secrets from AWS SSM Parameter Store as [environment secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html#environment-secrets).

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Follow the AWS SSM Parameter Store Integration guide">
        Follow the [KMS AWS SSM Parameter Store Integration Guide](./aws-parameter-store) to set up the integration. Pause once you reach the step where it asks you to select the path you would like to sync.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Find your Amplify App ID">
        ![amplify app id](../../images/integrations/aws/integrations-amplify-app-id.png)
        1. Open your AWS Amplify App console.
        2. Go to **Actions >> View App Settings**
        3. The App ID will be the last part of the App ARN field after the slash.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set AWS SSM Parameter Store path">
        You need to set the path in the format `/amplify/[amplify_app_id]/[your-amplify-environment-name]` as the path option in AWS SSM Parameter KMS Integration.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

<Info>
  Accessing an environment secret during a build is similar to accessing
  environment variables, except that environment secrets are stored in
  `process.env.secrets` as a JSON string.
