Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [KMS Cloud](https://kms.lux.network)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authorize KMS for Checkly">
    Obtain a Checkly API Key in User Settings > API Keys.

    Navigate to your project's integrations tab in KMS.

    Press on the Checkly tile and input your Checkly API Key to grant KMS access to your Checkly account.

  <Step title="Start integration">
    Select which KMS environment secrets you want to sync to Checkly and press create integration to start syncing secrets.

    <Note>
      KMS integrates with Checkly's environment variables at the **global** and **group** levels.
      
      To sync secrets to a specific group, you can select a group from the Checkly Group dropdown; otherwise, leaving it empty will sync secrets globally.
    </Note>

    <Info>
      In the new version of the Checkly integration, you are able to specify suffixes that depend on the secrets' environment and path. 
      If you choose to do so, you should utilize such suffixes for ALL Checkly integrations – otherwise the integration system 
      might run into issues with deleting secrets from the wrong environments.
