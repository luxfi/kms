When integrating your infrastructure with KMS Cloud, you may need to configure network access controls. This page provides the IP addresses that KMS uses to communicate with your services.

## KMS IP Addresses

KMS Cloud operates from multiple regions. If your infrastructure has strict network policies, you may need to allow traffic from KMS by adding the following IP addresses to your ingress rules. These are the IP addresses that KMS uses when making outbound requests to your services.
