<Info>
  LDAP is a paid feature. If you're using KMS Cloud, then it is available
  under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting KMS, then you
  should contact sales@lux.network to purchase an enterprise license to use
  it.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in KMS to have members authenticate with the platform via [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)

Prerequisites:

- You must have an email address to use LDAP, regardless of whether or not you use that email address to sign in.

<Steps>
   <Step title="Prepare the LDAP configuration in KMS">
        In KMS, head to the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** page and select the **General** tab. Select **Connect** for **LDAP**.

        ![LDAP SSO Connect](../../../images/sso/connect-ldap.png)

        Next, input your LDAP server settings.

        ![LDAP configuration](/images/platform/ldap/ldap-config.png)

        Here's some guidance for each field:

        - URL: The LDAP server to connect to such as `ldap://ldap.your-org.com`, `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636` (for connection over SSL/TLS), etc.
        - Bind DN: The distinguished name of object to bind when performing the user search such as `cn=kms,ou=Users,dc=acme,dc=com`.
        - Bind Pass: The password to use along with `Bind DN` when performing the user search.
        - User Search Base / User DN: Base DN under which to perform user search such as `ou=Users,dc=acme,dc=com`.
        - Unique User Attribute: The attribute to use as the unique identifier of LDAP users such as `sAMAccountName`, `cn`, `uid`, `objectGUID` ... If left blank, defaults to `uidNumber`
        - User Search Filter (optional): Template used to construct the LDAP user search filter such as `(uid={{username}})`; use literal `{{username}}` to have the given username used in the search. The default is `(uid={{username}})` which is compatible with several common directory schemas.
        - Group Search Base / Group DN (optional): LDAP search base to use for group membership search such as `ou=Groups,dc=acme,dc=com`.
        - Group Filter (optional): Template used when constructing the group membership query such as `(&(objectClass=posixGroup)(memberUid={{.Username}}))`. The template can access the following context variables: [`UserDN`, `UserName`]. The default is `(|(memberUid={{.Username}})(member={{.UserDN}})(uniqueMember={{.UserDN}}))` which is compatible with several common directory schemas.
        - CA Certificate: The CA certificate to use when verifying the LDAP server certificate.

     <Note>
          The **Group Search Base / Group DN** and **Group Filter** fields are both required if you wish to sync LDAP groups to KMS.
     </Note>

   </Step>
   <Step title="Test the LDAP connection">
      Once you've filled out the LDAP configuration, you can test that part of the configuration is correct by pressing the **Test Connection** button.

      KMS will attempt to bind to the LDAP server using the provided **URL**, **Bind DN**, and **Bind Pass**. If the operation is successful, then KMS will display a success message; if not, then KMS will display an error message and provide a fuller error in the server logs.

    </Step>

   <Step title="Define mappings from LDAP groups to groups in KMS">
     In order to sync LDAP groups to KMS, head to the **LDAP Group Mappings** section to define mappings from LDAP groups to groups in KMS.
     
     ![LDAP group mappings section](/images/platform/ldap/ldap-group-mappings-section.png)
     
     Group mappings ensure that users who log into KMS via LDAP are added to or removed from the KMS group(s) that corresponds to the LDAP group(s) they are a member of.
     
     ![LDAP group mappings table](/images/platform/ldap/ldap-group-mappings-table.png)
     
     Each group mapping consists of two parts: 
     - LDAP Group CN: The common name of the LDAP group to map.
     - KMS Group: The KMS group to map the LDAP group to.
     
     For example, suppose you want to automatically add a user who is part of the LDAP group with CN `Engineers` to the KMS group `Engineers` when the user sets up their account with KMS.
     
     In this case, you would specify a mapping from the LDAP group with CN `Engineers` to the KMS group `Engineers`.
     Now when the user logs into KMS via LDAP, KMS will check the LDAP groups that the user is a part of whilst referencing the group mappings you created earlier. Since the user is a member of the LDAP group with CN `Engineers`, they will be added to the KMS group `Engineers`.
     In the future, if the user is no longer part of the LDAP group with CN `Engineers`, they will be removed from the KMS group `Engineers` upon their next login.
     <Note>
          Prior to defining any group mappings, ensure that you've created the KMS groups that you want to map the LDAP groups to.
          You can read more about creating (user) groups in KMS [here](/documentation/platform/groups).
     </Note>
   </Step>
   <Step title="Enable LDAP in KMS">
        Enabling LDAP allows members in your organization to log into KMS via LDAP.
