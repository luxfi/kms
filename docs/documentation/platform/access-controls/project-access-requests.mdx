The Project Access Request feature allows users to view all projects within organization, including those they don't currently have access to.
Users can request access to these projects by submitting a request that automatically notifies project administrators via email, along with any comments provided by the user.

# Viewing Available Projects

From the KMS dashboard, users can view all projects within the organization:

1.  Navigate to the main dashboard after logging in
2.  The overview page for each product displays two tabs:

        		- **My Projects**: Projects you currently have access to
        		- **All Projects**: Complete list of projects in the organization
