**OCI Auth** is an OCI-native authentication method that verifies Oracle Cloud Infrastructure users through signature validation, allowing secure access to KMS resources.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the OCI Auth workflow for authenticating OCI users with KMS.

## Concept

At a high level, KMS authenticates an OCI user by verifying its identity and checking that it meets specific requirements (e.g., its username is authorized, its part of a tenancy) at the `/api/v1/auth/oci-auth/login` endpoint. If successful,
then KMS returns a short-lived access token that can be used to make authenticated requests to the KMS API.

To be more specific:
1. The client [signs](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/signingrequests.htm) a `/20160918/users/{userId}` request using an OCI user's [private key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#Required_Keys_and_OCIDs); this is done using the [OCI SDK](https://lux.network/docs/documentation/platform/identities/oci-auth#accessing-the-kms-api-with-the-identity) or API.
2. The client sends the signed request's headers and their user OCID to KMS at the `/api/v1/auth/oci-auth/login` endpoint.
3. KMS reconstructs the request and sends it to OCI via the [Get User](https://docs.oracle.com/en/engineered-systems/private-cloud-appliance/3.0-latest/ceapi/op-20160918-users-user_id-get.html) endpoint for verification and obtains the identity associated with the OCI user.
4. KMS checks the user's properties against set criteria such as **Allowed Usernames** and **Tenancy OCID**.
5. If all checks pass, KMS returns a short-lived access token that the client can use to make authenticated requests to the KMS API.

## Prerequisite

In order to sign requests, you must have an OCI user with credentials such as the private key. If you're unaware of how to create a user and obtain the needed credentials, expand the menu below.

## Guide

In the following steps, we explore how to create and use identities for your workloads and applications on OCI to
access the KMS API using the OCI request signing authentication method.

### Creating an identity

To create an identity, head to your Organization Settings > Access Control > [Identities](https://kms.lux.network/organization/access-management?selectedTab=identities) and press **Create identity**.

![identities organization](/images/platform/identities/identities-org.png)

When creating an identity, you specify an organization-level [role](/documentation/platform/role-based-access-controls) for it to assume; you can configure roles in Organization Settings > Access Control > [Organization Roles](https://kms.lux.network/organization/access-management?selectedTab=roles).

![identities organization create](/images/platform/identities/identities-org-create.png)

Input some details for your new identity:
- **Name (required):** A friendly name for the identity.
- **Role (required):** A role from the [**Organization Roles**](https://kms.lux.network/organization/access-management?selectedTab=roles) tab for the identity to assume. The organization role assigned will determine what organization-level resources this identity can have access to.

Once you've created an identity, you'll be redirected to a page where you can manage the identity.

![identities page](/images/platform/identities/identities-page.png)

Since the identity has been configured with [Universal Auth](https://lux.network/docs/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth) by default, you should reconfigure it to use OCI Auth instead. To do this, click the cog next to **Universal Auth** and then select **Delete** in the options dropdown.

![identities press cog](/images/platform/identities/identities-press-cog.png)

![identities page remove default auth](/images/platform/identities/identities-page-remove-default-auth.png)

Now create a new OCI Auth Method.

![identities create oci auth method](/images/platform/identities/identities-org-create-oci-auth-method.png)

Here's some information about each field:
- **Tenancy OCID:** The OCID of your tenancy. All users authenticating must be part of this Tenancy.
- **Allowed Usernames:** A comma-separated list of trusted OCI users that are allowed to authenticate with KMS.
- **Access Token TTL (default is `2592000` equivalent to 30 days):** The lifetime for an access token in seconds. This value will be referenced at renewal time.
- **Access Token Max TTL (default is `2592000` equivalent to 30 days):** The maximum lifetime for an access token in seconds. This value will be referenced at renewal time.
- **Access Token Max Number of Uses (default is `0`):** The maximum number of times that an access token can be used; a value of `0` implies an infinite number of uses.
- **Access Token Trusted IPs:** The IPs or CIDR ranges that access tokens can be used from. By default, each token is given the `0.0.0.0/0`, allowing usage from any network address.

### Adding an identity to a project

In order to allow an identity to access project-level resources such as secrets, you must add it to the relevant projects.

To do this, head over to the project you want to add the identity to and navigate to Project Settings > Access Control > Machine Identities and press **Add Identity**.

![identities project](/images/platform/identities/identities-project.png)

Select the identity you want to add to the project and the project-level role you want it to assume. The project role given to the identity will determine what project-level resources this identity can access.

![identities project create](/images/platform/identities/identities-project-create.png)

### Accessing the KMS API with the identity

To access the KMS API as the identity, you need to construct a signed [Get User](https://docs.oracle.com/en/engineered-systems/private-cloud-appliance/3.0-latest/ceapi/op-20160918-users-user_id-get.html) request using [OCI Signature v1](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/signingrequests.htm#Request_Signatures) and then make a request to the `/api/v1/auth/oci-auth/login` endpoint passing the signed header data and user OCID.

Below is an example of how you can authenticate with KMS using the `oci-sdk` for NodeJS.

```typescript
import { common } from "oci-sdk";

// Change these credentials to match your OCI user
const tenancyId = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1..example";
const userId = "ocid1.user.oc1..example";
const fingerprint = "00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00";
const region = "us-ashburn-1";
const privateKey = "..."; // Must be PEM format

const provider = new common.SimpleAuthenticationDetailsProvider(
  tenancyId,
  userId,
  fingerprint,
  privateKey,
  null,
  common.Region.fromRegionId(region),
);

// Build request
const headers = new Headers({
  host: `identity.${region}.oraclecloud.com`,
});

const request: common.HttpRequest = {
  method: "GET",
  uri: `/20160918/users/${userId}`,
  headers,
  body: null,
};

// Sign request
const signer = new common.DefaultRequestSigner(provider);
await signer.signHttpRequest(request);

// Forward signed request to KMS
const requestAsJson = {
  identityId: "2dd11664-68e3-471d-b366-907206ab1bff",
  userOcid: userId,
  headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers.entries()),
};

const res = await fetch("https://kms.lux.network/api/v1/auth/oci-auth/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(requestAsJson),
});

const json = await res.json();

console.log("KMS Response:", json);
```

<Note>
    Each identity access token has a time-to-live (TTL) which you can infer from the response of the login operation; the default TTL is `7200` seconds, which can be adjusted.

    If an identity access token expires, it can no longer access the KMS API. A new access token should be obtained by performing another login operation.
</Note>
