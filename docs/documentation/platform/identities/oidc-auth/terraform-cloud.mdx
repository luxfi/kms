description: "How to authenticate with KMS from Terraform Cloud using OIDC."
---

This guide will walk you through setting up Terraform Cloud to inject a [workload identity token](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens) and use it for OIDC-based authentication with the KMS Terraform provider. You'll start by creating a machine identity in KMS, then configure Terraform Cloud to pass the injected token into your Terraform runs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Machine Identity in KMS">
    Follow the instructions [in this documentation](/documentation/platform/identities/oidc-auth/general) to create a machine identity with OIDC auth. KMS OIDC configuration values for Terraform Cloud:
    1. Set the OIDC Discovery URL to https://app.terraform.io.
    2. Set the Issuer to https://app.terraform.io.
    3. Configure the Audience to match the value you will use for **TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE** in Terraform Cloud for the next step.

    
    To view all possible claims available from Terraform cloud, visit [HashiCorpâ€™s documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens#token-structure).

  <Step title="Enable Workload Identity Token Injection in Terraform Cloud">

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Generate single token">
        1. **Navigate to your workspace** in Terraform Cloud.  
        2. **Add a workspace variable** named `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE`:
          - **Key**: `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE`
          - **Value**: For example, `my-kms-audience`
          - **Category**: Environment

        > **Important**:  
        > - The presence of `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE` is required for Terraform Cloud to inject a token.  
        > - If you are self-hosting HCP Terraform agents, ensure they are **v1.7.0 or above**.

        Once set, Terraform Cloud will inject a workload identity token into the run environment as `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN`.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="(Optional) Generate Multiple Tokens">
        If you need multiple tokens (each with a different audience), create additional variables:

        ```
        TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE_[YOUR_TAG_HERE]
        ```

        For example:
        - `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE_KMS`
        - `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE_OTHER_SERVICE`

        Terraform Cloud will then inject:
        - `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_KMS`
        - `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_OTHER_SERVICE`

        > **Note**:  
        > - The `[YOUR_TAG_HERE]` can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.  
        > - You **cannot** use the reserved keyword `TYPE`.  
        > - Generating multiple tokens requires **v1.12.0 or later** if you are self-hosting agents.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Warning>
      If you are running on self-hosted HCP Terraform agents, you must use v1.7.0 or later to enable token injection. If you need to generate multiple tokens, you must use v1.12.0 or later.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the KMS Provider">
    In your Terraform configuration, reference the injected token by name. For example:

    ```hcl
    provider "kms" {
      host = "https://kms.lux.network"

      auth = {
        oidc = {
          identity_id = "<identity-id>"
          # This must match the environment variable Terraform injects:
          token_environment_variable_name = "TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    - **`host`**: Defaults to `https://kms.lux.network`. Override if using a self-hosted KMS instance.
    - **`identity_id`**: The OIDC identity ID from KMS.
    - **`token_environment_variable_name`**: Must match the injected variable name from Terraform Cloud. If using single token, use `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN`. If using multiple tokens, choose the one you want to use (e.g., `TFC_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_TOKEN_KMS`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate Your Setup">
    1. Run a plan and apply in Terraform Cloud.  
    2. Verify the KMS provider authenticates successfully without issues. If you run into authentication errors, double-check the KMS identity has the correct roles/permissions in KMS.

  </Step>
