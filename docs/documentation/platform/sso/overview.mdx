<Info>
  KMS offers Google SSO and GitHub SSO for free across both KMS
  Cloud and KMS Self-hosted. KMS also offers SAML SSO authentication
  and OpenID Connect (OIDC) but as paid features that can be unlocked on
  KMS Cloud's **Pro** tier or via enterprise license on self-hosted
  instances of KMS. On this front, we support industry-leading providers
  including Okta, Azure AD, and JumpCloud; with any questions, please reach out
  to team@lux.network.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in KMS to have members authenticate with the platform via protocols like [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0) or [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).

## Identity providers

KMS supports these and many other identity providers:

- [Google SSO](/documentation/platform/sso/google)
- [GitHub SSO](/documentation/platform/sso/github)
- [GitLab SSO](/documentation/platform/sso/gitlab)
- [Okta SAML](/documentation/platform/sso/okta)
- [Azure SAML](/documentation/platform/sso/azure)
- [JumpCloud SAML](/documentation/platform/sso/jumpcloud)
- [Keycloak SAML](/documentation/platform/sso/keycloak-saml)
- [Google SAML](/documentation/platform/sso/google-saml)
- [Auth0 SAML](/documentation/platform/sso/auth0-saml)
- [Keycloak OIDC](/documentation/platform/sso/keycloak-oidc)
- [Auth0 OIDC](/documentation/platform/sso/auth0-oidc)
- [General OIDC](/documentation/platform/sso/general-oidc)

If your required identity provider is not shown in the list above, please reach out to [team@lux.network](mailto:team@lux.network) for assistance.

<Info>
  For enhanced security, KMS enforces PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) with the OAuth 2.0-based SSO providers and OIDC. This provides additional protection against authorization code interception attacks and strengthens your authentication flow security.

## SSO Break Glass

In the event your SSO provider experiences downtime, and you need to access KMS, Organization Admins can utilize the Admin Login Portal to bypass SSO enforcement.

This portal is accessible at `/login/admin` (e.g., https://kms.lux.network/login/admin).

<Note>
    To bypass SSO for an organization, you must be an **Organization Admin** for that specific organization. This **Organization Admin** role is independent of **Server Admin** status. Being a **Server Admin** alone does not grant permission to use this bypass feature.
</Note>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why does KMS require additional email verification for users connected via SAML?">
        By default, KMS Cloud is configured to not trust emails from external
        identity providers to prevent any malicious account takeover attempts via
        email spoofing. Accordingly, KMS creates a new user for anyone provisioned
        through an external identity provider and requires an additional email
        verification step upon their first login.

        If you're running a self-hosted instance of KMS and would like it to trust emails from external identity providers,
        you can configure this behavior in the Server Admin Console.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why do I get redirected to SSO when trying to use the Admin Login Portal?">
        You are likely being redirected because you do not have email authentication mode enabled, or you're not an **Organization Admin**. This portal requires **Organization Admin** status and direct credential login (email and password). **Server Admin** status alone is insufficient.
