You can have KMS automatically sync group
memberships between your OIDC provider and KMS by configuring a `groups` claim on your provider tokens.
When a user logs in via OIDC, they will be added to KMS groups that are present in their OIDC `groups` claim,
and removed from any KMS groups not present in the claim.

<Info>
    When enabled, manual
    management of KMS group memberships will be disabled.
</Info>

<Warning>
    Group membership changes in your OIDC provider only sync with KMS when a
    user logs in via OIDC. For example, if you remove a user from a group in your OIDC provider,
    this change will not be reflected in KMS until their next OIDC login.
    To ensure this behavior, KMS recommends enabling Enforce OIDC SSO in the OIDC settings.
</Warning>


<Steps>
    <Step title="Configure a groups claim in your OIDC provider">
       To enable OIDC Group Membership Mapping, you must configure a `groups` claim in your OIDC provider.

        Add a `groups` property with a list of the user's OIDC group names to your token.

        Example of expected token payload:
        ```json
        {
            // "email": "john@provider.com",
            // "given_name": "John",
            // ...other claims
            "groups": ["Billing Group", "Sales Group"]
        }
        ```

        <Note>
            Setup varies between OIDC providers. Please refer to your OIDC provider's documentation for more information.
        </Note>

    <Step title="Setup groups in KMS and enable OIDC Group Membership Mapping">
        2.1. In KMS, create any groups you would like to sync users to. Make sure the name of the KMS group is an exact match of the OIDC group name.

        2.2. Next, enable **OIDC Group Membership Mapping** on the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** page under the **General** tab.
