The KMS AWS IAM dynamic secret allows you to generate AWS IAM Users on demand based on a configured AWS policy. KMS supports several authentication methods to connect to your AWS account, including assuming an IAM Role, using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) on EKS, or static Access Keys.

## Prerequisite

KMS needs an AWS IAM principal (a user or a role) with the required permissions to create and manage other IAM users. This principal will be responsible for the lifecycle of the dynamically generated users.

<Accordion title="Required IAM Permissions">

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:AttachUserPolicy",
        "iam:CreateAccessKey",
        "iam:CreateUser",
        "iam:DeleteAccessKey",
        "iam:DeleteUser",
        "iam:DeleteUserPolicy",
        "iam:DetachUserPolicy",
        "iam:GetUser",
        "iam:ListAccessKeys",
        "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
        "iam:ListGroupsForUser",
        "iam:ListUserPolicies",
        "iam:PutUserPolicy",
        "iam:AddUserToGroup",
        "iam:RemoveUserFromGroup",
        "iam:TagUser"
      ],
      "Resource": ["*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

To minimize managing user access you can attach a resource in format

> arn:aws:iam::\<account-id\>:user/\<aws-scope-path\>

Replace **\<account id\>** with your AWS account id and **\<aws-scope-path\>** with a path to minimize managing user access.

## Set up Dynamic Secrets with AWS IAM

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Assume Role (Recommended)">
    KMS will assume the provided role in your AWS account securely, without the need to share any credentials.
        <Accordion title="Self-Hosted Instance">
            To connect your self-hosted KMS instance with AWS, you need to set up an AWS IAM User account that can assume the configured AWS IAM Role.

            If your instance is deployed on AWS, the aws-sdk will automatically retrieve the credentials. Ensure that you assign the provided permission policy to your deployed instance, such as ECS or EC2.

            The following steps are for instances not deployed on AWS:
            <Steps>
                <Step title="Create an IAM User">
                    Navigate to [Create IAM User](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create) in your AWS Console.
                </Step>
                <Step title="Create an Inline Policy">
                    Attach the following inline permission policy to the IAM User to allow it to assume any IAM Roles:
                    ```json
                    {
                        "Version": "2012-10-17",
                        "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Sid": "AllowAssumeAnyRole",
                        "Effect": "Allow",

    <Steps>
         <Step title="Create the Managing User IAM Role for KMS">
                1. Navigate to the [Create IAM Role](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles/create?step=selectEntities) page in your AWS Console.
                ![IAM Role Creation](/images/integrations/aws/integration-aws-iam-assume-role.png)

                2. Select **AWS Account** as the **Trusted Entity Type**.
                3. Select **Another AWS Account** and provide the appropriate KMS AWS Account ID: use **381492033652** for the **US region**, and **345594589636** for the **EU region**. This restricts the role to be assumed only by KMS. If self-hosting, provide your AWS account number instead.
                4. (Recommended) <strong>Enable "Require external ID"</strong> and input your **Project ID** to strengthen security and mitigate the [confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html).
                5. Assign permission as shared in prerequisite.

                <Warning type="warning" title="Security Best Practice: Use External ID to Prevent Confused Deputy Attacks">
                    When configuring an IAM Role that KMS will assume, itâ€™s highly recommended to enable the **"Require external ID"** option and specify your **Project ID**.

                    This precaution helps protect your AWS account against the [confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html), a potential security vulnerability where KMS could be tricked into performing actions on your behalf by an unauthorized actor.

                    <strong>Always enable "Require external ID" and use your Project ID when setting up the IAM Role.</strong>

      </Step>

      <Step title="Generate dynamic secrets">
        Once you've successfully configured the dynamic secret, you're ready to generate on-demand credentials.
        To do this, simply click on the 'Generate' button which appears when hovering over the dynamic secret item.
        Alternatively, you can initiate the creation of a new lease by selecting 'New Lease' from the dynamic secret lease list section.

        ![Dynamic Secret](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/dynamic-secret-generate.png)
        ![Dynamic Secret](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/dynamic-secret-lease-empty.png)

        When generating these secrets, it's important to specify a Time-to-Live (TTL) duration. This will dictate how long the credentials are valid for.

        ![Provision Lease](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/provision-lease.png)

        <Tip>
          Ensure that the TTL for the lease falls within the maximum TTL defined when configuring the dynamic secret in step 4.
        </Tip>

        Once you click the `Submit` button, a new secret lease will be generated and the credentials for it will be shown to you.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="IRSA (EKS)">
    This method is recommended for self-hosted KMS instances running on AWS EKS. It uses [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) to securely grant permissions to the KMS pods without managing static credentials.

    <Warning type="warning" title="IRSA Configuration Prerequisite">
        In order to use IRSA, the `KUBERNETES_AUTO_FETCH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable must be set to `true` for your self-hosted KMS instance.
    </Warning>

    <Steps>
        <Step title="Create an IAM OIDC provider for your cluster">
            If you don't already have one, you need to create an IAM OIDC provider for your EKS cluster. This allows IAM to trust authentication tokens from your Kubernetes cluster.
            1. Find your cluster's OIDC provider URL from the EKS console or by using the AWS CLI:
               `aws eks describe-cluster --name <your-cluster-name> --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text`
            2. Navigate to the [IAM Identity Providers](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/providers) page in your AWS Console and create a new OpenID Connect provider with the URL and `sts.amazonaws.com` as the audience.

            ![Create OIDC Provider Placeholder](/images/integrations/aws/irsa-create-oidc-provider.png)
        </Step>
        <Step title="Create the Managing User IAM Role for KMS">
            1. Navigate to the [Create IAM Role](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles/create?step=selectEntities) page in your AWS Console.
            2. Select **Web identity** as the **Trusted Entity Type**.
            3. Choose the OIDC provider you created in the previous step.
            4. For the **Audience**, select `sts.amazonaws.com`.
            ![IAM Role Creation for IRSA](/images/integrations/aws/irsa-iam-role-creation.png)
            5. Attach the permission policy detailed in the **Prerequisite** section at the top of this page.
            6. After creating the role, edit its **Trust relationship** to specify the service account KMS is using in your cluster. This ensures only the KMS pod can assume this role.

            ```json
            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Effect": "Allow",

                            "StringEquals": {
                                "oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC_ID>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<K8S_NAMESPACE>:<KMS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>",
                                "oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC_ID>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
            ```
            Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>`, `<REGION>`, `<OIDC_ID>`, `<K8S_NAMESPACE>`, and `<KMS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>` with your specific values.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Annotate the KMS Kubernetes Service Account">
            For the IRSA mechanism to work, the KMS service account in your Kubernetes cluster must be annotated with the ARN of the IAM role you just created.

            Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with your values:
            ```bash
            kubectl annotate serviceaccount -n <kms-namespace> <kms-service-account> \
            eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<iam-role-name>
            ```
            This annotation tells the EKS Pod Identity Webhook to inject the necessary environment variables and tokens into the KMS pod, allowing it to assume the specified IAM role.
