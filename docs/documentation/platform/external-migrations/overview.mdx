## Overview

KMS supports migrating secrets from third-party secrets management platforms to KMS. This is useful if you're looking to easily switch to KMS and wish to move over your existing secrets from a different platform.

## Supported Platforms

- [EnvKey](./envkey)
- [Vault](./vault)

We're always looking to add more migration paths for other providers. If we're missing a platform, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kms/kms/issues).
