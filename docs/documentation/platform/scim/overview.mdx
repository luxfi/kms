<Note>
  SCIM provisioning can only be enabled when either SAML or OIDC is setup for
  the organization.
</Note>
<Info>
  SCIM provisioning is a paid feature. If you're using KMS Cloud, then it
  is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting KMS,
  then you should contact sales@lux.network to purchase an enterprise license
  to use it.
</Info>

You can configure your organization in KMS to have users and user groups be provisioned/deprovisioned using [SCIM](https://scim.cloud/#Implementations2) via providers like Okta, Azure, JumpCloud, etc.

- Provisioning: The SCIM provider pushes user information to KMS. If the user exists in KMS, KMS sends an email invitation to add them to the relevant organization in KMS; if not, KMS initializes a new user and sends them an email invitation to finish setting up their account in the organization.
- Deprovisioning: The SCIM provider instructs KMS to remove user(s) from an organization in KMS.
