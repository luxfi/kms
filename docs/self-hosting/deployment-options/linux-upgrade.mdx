description: "How to upgrade KMS deployment using linux package"
---

This guide explains how to upgrade KMS Linux package installations to newer versions. 
The KMS Linux package includes only the KMS service component itself, as PostgreSQL and Redis databases are managed separately. 
Upgrades for PostgreSQL and Redis are not covered in this guide as they depend on your specific database deployment method.

## Upgrade Options

There are two primary methods to upgrade KMS:

1. **Standard Upgrade (with brief downtime)**: The simplest approach that briefly takes KMS offline during the upgrade.
2. **Minimal-Downtime Upgrade**: For multi-node deployments where high availability is required.

## Before You Begin

### Checking Your Current Version

Before upgrading, note your current KMS version:

```bash
cat /opt/kms-core/version-manifest.txt
```

Look for `kms` component. This will be the version of KMS currently installed.

### Prerequisites

- Verify that your PostgreSQL and Redis instances are up and running
- Back up your PostgreSQL database before proceeding with any upgrade
- Review release notes for the version you're upgrading to

### Creating a Database Backup

We strongly recommend backing up your database before upgrading. 
Your backup approach may look different depending on how you configured PostgreSQL and whether it's self-managed or using a managed service. 
Here is a sample of how you would perform a manual backup:

```bash
# Example PostgreSQL backup command (adjust parameters as needed)
pg_dump -U <username> -h <db-host> -d <db-name> > kms_backup.sql
```

### Database Migrations During Upgrade

By default, KMS runs database migrations automatically on startup.  

- It uses database locks to ensure only one instance runs migrations at a time
- Other instances will wait for the lock to be released before continuing startup
- This prevents race conditions and database conflicts

## Standard Upgrade (with Downtime)

This method is suitable for single-node deployments or situations where a brief downtime is acceptable.

<Steps>

   ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Minimal-Downtime Upgrade

For multi-node setups where you need to maintain availability during upgrades, follow this procedure. This approach requires at least two KMS nodes behind a load balancer.

### Understanding Traffic Draining

"Draining" a server means gracefully removing it from the pool of active servers without disrupting existing connections. When you drain a server:

1. The load balancer stops sending new requests to the server
2. Existing connections are allowed to complete naturally
3. Once all connections finish, the server can be safely taken offline for maintenance

This approach ensures users/machines do not experience sudden connection errors during the upgrade process.

### Preparing for the Upgrade

1. **Designate a deploy node**: Choose any single node that will run migrations. This node will be upgraded first.

2. **Configure your load balancer**: Ensure your load balancer can perform health checks against KMS's `api/status` endpoint.

### Upgrade Process

#### On the deploy node:

<Steps>
<Step title="Drain traffic from the node">
   
Drain the traffic on this node gracefully. You can do this in a number of ways depending on the load balancer you have configured. 
Approaches for some common load balancers are provided below:

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="NGINX">
      If using NGINX as a load balancer, you can remove the server from the upstream pool temporarily:
      ```bash
      # Edit your NGINX configuration to comment out or remove the server
      sudo nano /path/to/your/nginx-config.conf
      
      # Reload NGINX to apply changes
      sudo nginx -s reload
      ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="HAProxy">
      If using HAProxy, you can put the server in maintenance mode:
      ```bash
      # Using the HAProxy socket command
      echo "disable server kms_backend/kms-node1" | socat stdio /var/lib/haproxy/stats
      ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="AWS ALB/ELB">
      Deregister the instance from the load balancer using the AWS console or CLI
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Other load balancers">
      Follow your load balancer's documentation for instructions on draining procedure
   </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify no new traffic is arriving">
Verify no new traffic is arriving before proceeding with the upgrade.
</Step>

<Step title="Stop KMS on this node">

kms-ctl stop
```
</Step>

<Step title="Upgrade the KMS package">

   ```bash
   sudo yum update kms-core
   ```

</Step>

<Step title="Return this node to load balancer pool">
Re-enable the server in your load balancer using the same method you used to remove it.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### On all remaining nodes (one at a time):

<Steps>
<Step title="Drain traffic from the node">
Follow the same draining procedure as described for the deploy node:
   
- Remove the server from your load balancer's active pool
- Wait for existing connections to complete
- Verify the node is no longer receiving traffic
</Step>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Migration Issues">
If you encounter database migration issues:

1. Check the logs:
   ```bash
   kms-ctl tail
   ```

2. Ensure the database user has sufficient privileges to create/modify tables.

3. If migrations fail repeatedly, consider restoring from the backup you took prior to upgrading. 

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Service Won't Start After Upgrade">
1. Check for configuration errors:
   ```bash
   kms-ctl tail
   kms-ctl status
   ```

2. Verify all required environment variables are set in your `/etc/kms/kms.rb` file.
