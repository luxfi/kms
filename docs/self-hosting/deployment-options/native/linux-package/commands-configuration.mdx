## Configuration Overview

All configuration for the KMS Linux package is managed through a single file called `kms.rb`, located in the `/etc/kms` directory. 
This file defines all necessary settings, including encryption keys, database connections, and environment-specific settings.

<Info> After making any changes to the `kms.rb` file, always run `kms-ctl reconfigure` to apply them. </Info>

### Example Configuration

```ruby kms.rb
# Important: Replace these values with secure keys in production
kms_core['ENCRYPTION_KEY'] = '6c1fe4e407b8911c104518103505b218'
kms_core['AUTH_SECRET'] = '5lrMXKKWCVocS/uerPsl7V+TX/aaUaI7iDkgl3tSmLE='

# Database connection strings
kms_core['DB_CONNECTION_URI'] = 'postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:5432/<database>'
kms_core['REDIS_URL'] = 'redis://<host>:6379'
```

For a full list of supported configuration variables, refer to the [configuration variables documentation](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
