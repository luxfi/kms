description: "Reference architecture for self-hosting KMS on Google Cloud Run."
---

## Overview
This guide outlines a reference architecture for deploying KMS in a self-hosted configuration using Google Cloud Run. 
It is intended to provide a scalable, secure, and production-ready baseline for organizations choosing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as their infrastructure provider.

## Core Components

- **Cloud Run:** KMS service is containerized and deployed as fully managed Cloud Run services.

- **Cloud SQL:** KMS uses Postgres as its persistence layer. As such, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL is used.

- **MemoryStore for Redis:** To schedule jobs, process audit logs and cache  performance, KMS requires Redis.

## Securing KMS's root credential

- **Secrets Manager:** To secure KMSâ€™s root credentials (database connection string, encryption key, etc.), 
we highly recommend that you use Google Secrets Manager and only allow the tasks running KMS to access them.

## High Availability and Scalability

This architecture leverages Google Cloud's managed services to achieve high availability and scalability out of the box:

**Cloud Run:**

- Automatically scales the number of container instances up or down based on incoming request volume.
- Supports rapid scaling during traffic spikes, ensuring low latency.
- Configurable minimum and maximum instances to handle baseline and peak loads.

**Cloud SQL:**

- Provides high availability configurations (regional instances with automatic failover) to ensure database uptime.
- Automated backups, point-in-time recovery, and maintenance.

**MemoryStore:**

- Offers highly available Redis configurations with replication.
- Fully managed with automatic scaling and patching.

**Cloud Load Balancer:**

- Distributes user traffic across available Cloud Run instances.
- Provides SSL termination, global load balancing, and health checks.

<Info>
  **Note:** To further improve performance and availability, consider enabling multi-region deployment strategies,
   regional VPC Connectors, and database replicas for read-heavy workloads.

## Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provision Core Infrastructure">
  **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL):**
  - Create a Cloud SQL instance.
    - Under `Zonal availability`, select the `Multiple zones` option to ensure High Availability.
  - Configure private IP access.

  **MemoryStore (Redis):**
  - Deploy a Redis instance.
  - Configure VPC access.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the KMS Docker image">
    Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kms/kms/tags) and select a version of KMS image you would like to deploy.
    Then, within Cloud Run, paste the URL of the specific KMS Docker image you would like to use within the `Container image URL` field.

    Remember to replace `<version>` with the docker image tag of your choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the environment variables">
    For a minimal installation of KMS, you must configure the following environment variables:

    ```bash
    ENCRYPTION_KEY=<your_encryption_key>
    AUTH_SECRET=<your_auth_secret>
    DB_CONNECTION_URI="<your_db_connection_uri>"
    SITE_URL="<your_site_url>"
    REDIS_URL="<your_redis_url>"
    ```
  [View all available configurations](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).

    You will want to setup Postgres and Redis within Google Cloud Platform to connect to KMS.

    Once you have added the required environment variables to the `Environment Variables` section within Cloud Run, 
    create the container to get KMS up and running.

    <Warning>
      The above environment variable values are only to be used as an example and should not be used in production 
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Network Configuration">

  Enable `Connect to a VPC for outbound traffic`: This enables the service to talk to private resources (e.g., a Cloud SQL database, Redis instance on a private IP) inside your Google Cloud VPC network.

  Select `Send traffic directly to a VPC`: It gives lower latency and better performance, but uses more IPs from the subnet.

  <Info> 
    Your Cloud Run revision must be in the same VPC network

  Once the container is running, verify the installation by opening your web browser and navigating to the Site URL.
