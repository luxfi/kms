Welcome to KMS! 

The first few days of every new joiner are going to be packed with learning lots of new information, meeting new teammates, and understanding KMS on a deeper level. 

Plus, our team is remote-first and spread across the globe (from San Francisco to Philippines), so having a great onboarding experience is very important for the new joiner to feel part of the team and be excited about what we're doing as a company.

## Onboarding buddy

Every new joiner at KMS will have an onboarding buddy—a teammate in a similar time zone who’s there to help you settle in. They are your go-to person for any questions that come up. Of course, everyone on the team is happy to help, but it’s always nice to have a dedicated person who’s there for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out to your buddy if you’re unsure about something or need a hand! Your onboarding buddy will set up regular syncs for your first two months—ideally at least 2-3 times a week.

If you’re joining the engineering team, your onboarding buddy will:
1. Walk you through KMS’s development process and share any best practices to keep in mind when tackling tickets.
2. Be your go-to person if you are blocked or need to think through your sprint task.
3. Help you ship something small on day one!

## Onboarding Checklist

Your hiring manager will send you an onboarding checklist doc for your first day.
