KMS is actively growing and we are hiring for many positions at any given time. This page describes some details of the hiring process we have.

## Strategy

KMS recruitment strategy relies on 100% inbound interest by default. Many of our team members have previously used KMS or contributed to our [open source project](https://github.com/luxfi/kms). This allows us to hire the best candidates who are most interested in working at KMS.
